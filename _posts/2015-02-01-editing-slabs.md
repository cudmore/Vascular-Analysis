Each slab has a fit to the tube diameter. It is critical that this fit is correct. Most fits are correct (~90%) but the remaining bad fits need to be edited by hand.  

To manually set the radius:

- Switch to 'Manual', will show cursors on the intensity line in the 'Slab Radius Panel'.
- Drag the cursors to the correct positon, the red dots in the image will give you feedback.
- Click 'Commit'.
