####How do I move a node or slab?  
To move an object, a node or a slab you  
1. select the object you want to move (it will turn yellow)  
2. move to the imaging plane it will go to  
3. right-click the object and select the 'Move…' menu. You will see a red crosshair on the object.  
4. drag the object to the new x/y position (don't change the imaging plane)  
5. click away from the object to commit  

####I ran out of memory?
Stacks take up a lot of memory. When a stack window is closed it is still in memory. Unload unused stacks in the main Hyperstack panel with 'Unload Stacks'.

####My stack window is not behaving correctly?
Close and re-open the timepoint.

####My key-presses are not doing anyhting?
Make sure ‘Caps Lock’ is not on

####Where are my files?
d:\Users\cudmore\hyperstack\intermediate_hyperstack

####How do I copy a hyperstack from one computer to another?
You need to copy two things (i) the hyperstack file and (ii) the hyperstck folder  
For a hyperstack named a153_hs2, you need to copy:  
File: a153_hs2_T.ibw  
Folder: a153_hs2  


####bHyperstack is VERY particular about the placement of files on the hard-drive
Do NOT change the names of files on the hard-drive by hand
