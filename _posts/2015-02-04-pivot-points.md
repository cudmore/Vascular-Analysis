Pivot points allow 3D image stacks to be aligned from one timepoint to the next.

Any node can be a pivot point. Select the node and press 'Capture Pivot'.

The pivot point will only align stacks whose nodes are connected (see [FindPnts][1] for how to connect nodes together).

If the guess in FindPnts starts to be wrong, pick a pivot point near the nodes you are working on and the Guess should get better.
