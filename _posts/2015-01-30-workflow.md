####(1) make nodes/edges/slabs in one timepoint

Create a node: shift+click  
Create an edge: select a source done, N+click a destination node  
Create a slab: S-Click  

Once all slabs for an edge are done, review the slabs (and their radii) using left/right arrow keys.  

If marking a subset of edges, only mark edges where you would put more than one slab, e.g. don't score super short edges.  

If an edge has a pericyte try and get a slab centered on it. If this is not possible, annotate the edge with a note about the pericyte.  

Annotate your images (using node and edge notes) with anything that is out of the ordinary or just cool.  


####(2) make similar nodes/edges/slabs in the next timepoint


####(3) connect nodes and then edges from one timepoint to the next using FindPnts  


Quality Control (not sure the order here)  


####(4) check all slab diameters using search 'All Slabs'


####(5) make edge notes about pericytes


####(6) mark edges as diving (d) or surface (s)
