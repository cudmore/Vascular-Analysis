####Stack Alignment

The beautiful thing is we do not do alignment in the traditional sense, there is no need to modify your original .tif image files.  

Alignment is done by specifying a 'pivot point' that is common to all timepoints to be aligned.  

####Fitting tube diameters

Tube diameters are fit as threshold crossing at the half-width-at-full-maximal (HWFM)

####Sliding maximal z-projection

This is used to visualize slices above and below the current imaging plane.
