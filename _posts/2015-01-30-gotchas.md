####When you open a stack from hard-disk, give it some time.
If you jump right in and start clicking before the stack is fully loaded you may get errors.
This usually happens when loading a timepoint with the ‘Stack’ button in the main hyperstack window. It also happens when opening two timepoints from the Find Points interface.

####Selected objects including nodes, edges and slabs are not masked based on the visible imaging plane, they are visible in all imaging planes.
This can be confusing.

####Creating slabs on tubes that are coming in or out of the imaging plane can be a nuisance.
The slabs visually overlap. You will get the hang of it.

####Saving a hyperstack can be slow.
The program saves all timepoints every time you click ‘Save’.
